## Variate for React.js

Variate comes in the form of an [open source plugin for React](https://github.com/VariateApp/variate-react).

## About the plugin

The Variate plugin for React.js comes in two parts: 

**The Variate Engine** This is where the experimentation logic sits. 

**The Variate Context Library** This is what makes it easy to integrate that logic inside of your React.js application.

## How it works

The Variate React.js Library uses the Context API to access variate experiment data from React components. These are available both through a component or a custom hook. Read more about the context library [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
