# What is Variate Engine?

The **Variate Engine** is the core library powering Variate on your website. It is a direct dependency on all our plugins.

It will be responsible for multiple things:

- Load your experiments, variations, components and variables
- Automatically distribute your visitors into *buckets*
- Qualify your users into each experiments based on the view and segment settings
- It will allow you to track events to Variate or any custom analytics solution of your choice

Check out our [React](/react) and [Vue.js](/vue) documentation pages to learn how to use the Engine methods from your components.
